🌾 Farm Equipment Detector – Project Overview

The Farm Equipment Detector is a mobile application developed using Flutter that uses machine learning (TensorFlow Lite) to identify different types of farm equipment from images. Users can capture a photo or select one from the gallery, and the system will automatically classify the equipment.

This project demonstrates how AI and mobile technology can be applied in agriculture to improve equipment identification and awareness.

✨ Key Features

📷 Camera Detection

Capture real-time images of farm equipment using the device camera.

Automatically analyzes the image after capture.

🖼️ Gallery Image Selection

Choose an existing image from the phone gallery.

Useful for testing and reviewing stored images.

⚙️ On-Device Machine Learning (TFLite)

Uses a TensorFlow Lite model for fast and offline detection.

No internet connection required.

🏷️ Equipment Classification Result

Displays the detected equipment name (e.g., Tractor, Harvester, Plough).

Shows confidence score for prediction reliability.
